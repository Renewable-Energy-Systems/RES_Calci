  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: <strong>25 May 2025</strong></p>
  <p>
    Renewable Energy Systems&nbsp;Limited ("<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>", or
    "<strong>us</strong>") built the <em>RES Tools</em> mobile application ("<strong>the
    App</strong>") as a free utility. This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for anyone who decides to use the App.
  </p>
  <h2>1. Information We <em>Do Not</em> Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The App <strong>does not collect</strong> or transmit any personal data. All calculations (dew-point / ppm converter and spring-rate calculator) are executed entirely on your device. We do not require account registration, location access, camera, microphone, or storage permissions.
  </p>
  <h2>2. Log Data</h2>
  <p>
    The App itself does not create or send log data to our servers. However, in the event of a crash, your device’s operating system may generate diagnostic logs. These logs remain on your device unless you choose to share them with us for support.
  </p>
  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or social media plug-ins.</p>

  <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
  <p>Cookies are not used by the App.</p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because the App stores no personal information, there is no risk of data breach originating from the App itself. Standard device-level security (PIN, biometrics) is recommended.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is rated <strong>Everyone</strong> and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, reflected in the App Store listing.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>

    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact:
